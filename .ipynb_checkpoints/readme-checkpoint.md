# Business Challenge: Cohort Analysis for Ironhack Payments (Project 1)

## Introduction

IronHack Payments, a forward-thinking financial services company, has been offering innovative cash advance solutions since its inception in 2020. With a commitment to providing money advancements for free and transparent pricing, IronHack Payments has garnered a substantial user base. As part of their continuous effort to enhance their services and understand user behavior, IronHack Payments has commissioned a cohort analysis project.

## Project Overview

In this project, we will conduct a comprehensive cohort analysis based on data provided by IronHack Payments. The main objective is to analyze user cohorts defined by the month of creation of their first cash advance. We will track the monthly evolution of key metrics for these cohorts, enabling IronHack Payments to gain valuable insights into user behavior and the performance of their financial services.

### Metrics to Analyze

We will calculate and analyze the following metrics for each cohort:

1. **Frequency of Service Usage:** Understand how often users from each cohort utilize IronHack Payments' cash advance services over time.
2. **Incident Rate:** Determine the incident rate, specifically focusing on payment incidents, for each cohort. Identify if there are variations in incident rates among different cohorts.
3. **Revenue Generated by the Cohort:** Calculate the total revenue generated by each cohort over months to assess the financial impact of user behavior.
4. **New Relevant Metric:** Propose and calculate a new relevant metric that provides additional insights into user behavior or the performance of IronHack Payments' services.

### Data Analysis Tools

We performed the cohort analysis using Python, primarily leveraging the Pandas library for data manipulation and analysis.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Before diving into cohort analysis, we conducted an exploratory data analysis to gain a comprehensive understanding of the dataset. 

### Data Quality Analysis

We assessed the quality of the dataset by identifying missing values, implemented data cleaning and preprocessing steps to ensure the reliability of our analysis.
